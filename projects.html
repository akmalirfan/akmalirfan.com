        <h3><a href="waktusolat">Waktu Solat</a></h3>
        <p class="small">
            This is a mini project born out of frustration of zooming in on the XML output from e-Solat.
            The time for each prayer is displayed on a timeline. This makes it easy to visualize, for example,
            how much time do we have before the next prayer so that we can prepare ourselves for it. On supported mobile
            browser, this web app can be added to the home screen for better experience.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="fuelprices">Fuel Prices</a></h3>
        <p class="small">
            This is another mini project born out of frustration of not knowing the amount that has to be
            paid for X liters of fuel. To use it, just enter the amount of fuel in the space provided and
            bookmark the link or even better, on supported mobile browser, add it to your home screen. Every
            time you open it, the web app will display the current fuel price for the amount of fuel that
            has been previously entered.
